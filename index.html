	  <p>Since the late 1990s, the Jamaican government has set an agenda to push the development of technology in Jamaica. The goal is to make Jamaica a significant

   	  and 2) to leverage its use to enhance societal needs.  Read more on<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_Jamaica"> Jamaica's Technology Developement</a></p></center>

	  Everyone else can go online through state-owned Internet centers or at a handful of luxury hotels catering to foreign tourists. Online access generally 
	  costs about $5 an hour, more than most Cubans earn in a week.  Read more on<a href="http://fortune.com/2016/11/26/fidel-castro-death-cuba-tech/"> Cuba's Lack of Technologies</a></p></center>
